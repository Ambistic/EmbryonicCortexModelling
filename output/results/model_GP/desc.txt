This model introduces a third type of progenitor, the Glial Progenitor.
It acts like a quiescent progenitor that does not divide here.

There are four parameters
Tc_IP : Time of cell cycle for IP
Tc_RG : Time of cell cycle for RG
Diff_IP : Probability of self renewing, otherwise differentiating to neuron, for IP
Diff_RG_IP, Diff_RG_GP : Probability of self renewing is the first, probability of giving an IP is second - first,
finally probability of giving a GP is 1 - second, for RG



Tc was determined by TLV data but we did not make a difference between IP and RG.

Diff were made from BiState model and simply adding a Diff_RG_GP term to fit the IP ratio in late neurogenesis
