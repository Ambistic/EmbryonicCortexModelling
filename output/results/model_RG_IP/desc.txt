This model uses two types of progenitors, RG and IP.

There are four parameters
Tc_IP : Time of cell cycle for IP
Tc_RG : Time of cell cycle for RG
Diff_IP : Probability of self renewing, otherwise differentiating to neuron, for IP
Diff_RG : Probability of self renewing, otherwise differentiating to IP, for RG


Tc was determined by TLV data but we did not make a difference between IP and RG.

Diff for both RG and IP was made arbitrarily, for RG we took previous diff values and
we diminished them a bit because the second progenitor would increase effective
self renewing value.

For IP we took a small value compared to RG.

The results fit well with the biological data of IP (Tbr2) ratio in the progenitor population.

At the end it does not fit anymore, but it is likely due to the new differentiation path
related to gliogenesis.

Variance analysis :
We used the model with standard parameters, and 16 cells at the beginning.
We found a huge standard variation (900.4932875790913) and a mean of 3944.595 which is 22.8%

With 36 cells at the beginning we end with
We found a relatively lower standard variation (1411.7134329512487) and a mean of 9024.615 which is 15.6%

With 64 cells a the beginning :
Stantard variation (1975.8428617681113) for a mean (16510.16) which is 12.0%

We arbitrarily estimate that a good compromise is 25 cells at the beginning, and a goal of 5% for 90%CI

Robustness analysis :

Coefficient of variation, define by dA/dB * B/A, where A is the number of final neuron
and B is the evaluated parameter.

We use a specific method for variating a proportion such that variation the proportion p
by a factor C is the same as a the complement of the variation of the proportion p' = 1 - p
by a factor C' = 1 / C


We clearly that neuron number is influenced by Tc_RG and diff_RG but almost not but parameters of IP. And the sooner is the perturbation, the higher is the change (the lower is the robustness)

Ratio of IP seems to be robust to all parameters, it is only influenced a bit for late perturbation. This also means that a drastic modification in the model is required in order to fit the biological IP ratio.

Finally, we plotted a clone from an initial cell and figured out two things :
- The lack of correlation between Tc of daughter and mother cell does not fit well with real data.
- We see that often neurons are created by pairs, but in our data we see mainly asymetrical divisions for neurons


Deep Tc analysis :
We aimed to check if the model did fit data such as correlation of Tc in a lineage.

We used 3 metrics :
- Ratio of progeny pairs (2 cycling, 1 cycling + 1 pm, 2pm)
- Correlation of Tc between cell daughters, and between mother and daughter
- Mean Tc increase

We always divide the cells into two groups, group 2 below E75 and group 3 above E75.

Progeny pairs :
For group 2, data was not sufficient.
For group 3, we saw that the data showed way more cycling daughter than expected. We considered that this was due to the difficulty of
classifying and added of probability of NOT putting NA for a PM, Pd. We then tried to fit a independant daughter model
with param Pc = probability of giving a cycling daughter. (Independant means that D2 fate does not depend on D1 fate).

As a result, the model gave 821 double cycling, 646 1 + 1, and 975 double pm.
The data was 43 double cycling, 14 1 + 1, and 7 double pm.

Basically, the model can be fitted using Pd = 0.4
This gives 43 double cycling, 35 1 + 1 and 44 double pm, which fits the agent-based model in terms of ratio.


Correlation in Tc :
We found in the data that there were no correlation between mother and daughter cells.
But between two daughter cell, we found some correlation (~0.20).
The exact same result were found in the model, which do not consider any link inside a clone, except time.
Therefore, we can hypothesize that time is the only relevant factor for the duration of cell cycle, and
it artificially brings a correlation.


Mean Tc increase :
We found a mean Tc increase of 1.08 both in the data and in the model.
Interestingly, we found that metric were biased because mean of the inverse was also 1.08. Therefore this metric is respected in the model
but does not reveal an augmentation.
